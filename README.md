->Our game is based on genre of a nightmare run and theme is food. It takes inspiration from
player being in a nightmare about dieting or food in general. We believe that a gameplay that
involves player being constantly running will suit better to game type of a 2D Platformer.

->The game offers a inventory box displayed on top of the screen throughout the gameplay.
Inside the inventory box the player could browse through the different types power ups or food
items. The power ups are acquired by killing the corresponding enemy and picking up the
dropped food power ups. For example : Killing a chip enemy drops the chip power up which
provide the player with a kind of fist attack. The powerups which are not yet acquired are show
in transparent icons in the inventory box.

-> All the levels are defined in the external level.txt files which could be edited and made custom levels.
